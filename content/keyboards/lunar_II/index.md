Lunar II w/ Alps SKCM Browns. Build commissed by [Karolingian Craft](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=Karolingian&ie=UTF-8). This board is unique in that it is currently the only board with a solenoid, which was intended to make it sound like a type writer. Tbh though, it is really loud and kind of annoying... so I turn it off most of the time.
